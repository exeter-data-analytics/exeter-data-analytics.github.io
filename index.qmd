Welcome to the homepage of the Exeter Data Analytics Hub.

## What is the Exeter Data Analytics Hub?

We are an inter-college team of volunteers at the University of Exeter aiming to enhance ECR training in open and reproducible science.

## Open and Reproducible Science Series

We host a monthly series of workshops and talks to promote Open and Reproducible Science throughout the life-cycle of a research project.

Visit the [Series](series.html) page to find out more.

## intRos Walkthroughs

Find brief introductions and walkthroughs on common research programming activities on the [Walkthroughs](posts.html) page.

## Old website content

There are a bunch of excellent resources made by previous members of the University of Exeter. These were hosted on a previous version of this website.
