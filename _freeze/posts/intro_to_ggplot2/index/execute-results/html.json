To explore data, to plot model results, just for the fun of making plots. I imagine we have all spent a huge amount of time making our plots ready for publication. Here we have a quick walkthrough of using **ggplot2** to create graphs for publication, and a few tips and tricks we have learned along the way. *If you have a favourite ggplot2 trick or tip then we would love for you to get in contact with us and for you add it to this walkthrough. Or if you're feeling adventurous, clone the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/exeter-data-analytics/intRos), add in your tip, re-render this quarto post, commit and push the changes, and start a Pull Request!*\n\n**ggplot2** is a popular data visualisation package in R that allows users to create high-quality and customisable graphics for data exploration, scientific publications, and presentations. Developed by Hadley Wickham, **ggplot2** is built on the principles of the Grammar of Graphics, which defines a set of rules for constructing and interpreting visualisations. With **ggplot2**, users can easily create a wide range of plots with advanced features such as facets, themes, and labels. Whether you are at the beginning of your science journey, or an old and grumpy PI, **ggplot2** provides a powerful and flexible tool for visualising data and gaining insights from it.\n\nMaking a **ggplot2** is like writing and following a recipe. You start with the first instructions (a call to **ggplot()**), the next instruction (like the next item of the recipe) is signalled using a `+`, a new line, and new instructions are added sequentially. **ggplot2** works in a sequential fashion, later instructions add to what is already there, and sometimes counteract or override what previous instructions.\n\n![Making a plot using **ggplot2** works much like a recipe](/posts/intro_to_ggplot2/Slide1.png)\n\n# Prerequisites\n\n-   Have R installed\n-   Have the **tidyverse** package installed\n-   Hopefully have a plot you want to make using **ggplot2** or have some aesthetics you would like to change on a current plot.\n\n# Learning objectives\n\n::: callout-note\n# Learning objectives\n\n**This introduction should allow you to:**\n\n-   Have a basic understanding of the way in which **ggplot2** \"works\" (i.e. the grammar of graphics)\n-   Understand the format data needs to be in to be used in **ggplot2**\n-   Make pubication-ready plots using **ggplot2**\n-   Know where to learn more about **ggplot2**\n:::\n\n# Making plots with ggplot2\n\nThis walkthrough will lean heavy on tools from the **tidyverse** for data wrangling, and the **palmerpenguins** package for the example data. The first thing we will do is load in the necessary packages and load in the dataset we will use to create our tables.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# load in required packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\nlibrary(MetBrewer)\nlibrary(patchwork)\n\n# load in data\ndata(\"penguins\")\nd <- penguins\n\n# have a look at the data\nglimpse(d)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 344\nColumns: 8\n$ species           <fct> Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adelie, Adel…\n$ island            <fct> Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgersen, Torgerse…\n$ bill_length_mm    <dbl> 39.1, 39.5, 40.3, NA, 36.7, 39.3, 38.9, 39.2, 34.1, …\n$ bill_depth_mm     <dbl> 18.7, 17.4, 18.0, NA, 19.3, 20.6, 17.8, 19.6, 18.1, …\n$ flipper_length_mm <int> 181, 186, 195, NA, 193, 190, 181, 195, 193, 190, 186…\n$ body_mass_g       <int> 3750, 3800, 3250, NA, 3450, 3650, 3625, 4675, 3475, …\n$ sex               <fct> male, female, female, NA, female, male, female, male…\n$ year              <int> 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007, 2007…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis dataset contain data for 344 penguins, consisting of three species of penguins, collected from 3 islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.\n\n## Preparing your dataset for ggplot2\n\nFor **ggplot2**, your data wants to be organised in long format, as opposed to wide.\n\n## Make a first plot using ggplot2\n\nWe will make a boxplot of how bill length changes between different species of penguin and add the raw points over the top. After making an initial plot call using **ggplot()**, different types of plot are specified using a **geom\\_** function (e.g. **geom_boxplot()** for boxplots, **geom_point()** for points, **geom_line()** for a line graph). In each layer, the **aes()** function is used to tell **ggplot2** which arguments depend on aspects of the dataset (e.g. col = species). Arguments set outside of **aes()** do not rely on the dataset (e.g. size = 3, col = 'black').\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# make first box plot with raw points\nggplot(d, aes(species, bill_length_mm, col = species)) + # add first empty plot layer\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + # add boxplot, do not plot the outliers\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2) # add jittered raw points\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/first_plot-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOk this looks nice. Here I put the **aes()** commands inside the original call to **ggplot()** as then those arguments are passed to all other layers (unless overridden by another **aes()**). This looks quite nice, but we can change a bunch of other things to make it look nicer.\n\n## Adding extra layers to ggplot2\n\nThere are a bunch of things I do as standard when I am making a plot (and a boxplot in particular):\n\n-   Change the axis labels\n-   Remove the legend if not needed\n-   Change the axis limits\n-   Change the theme and the text size\n-   I dislike the default box plot so I colour the whole thing and then add a median bar in white (see below)\n\nThe important thing is to create your own style. To do what you think looks best, but all the options are documented nicely on their [website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/). There are many more detailed resources around, so instead here we will document common things we do.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# make next box plot with raw points\np1 <- ggplot(d, aes(species, bill_length_mm, col = species, fill = species)) + # add first empty plot layer\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + # add boxplot, do not plot the outliers\n  stat_summary(geom = \"crossbar\", fatten = 2, color = \"white\", width = 0.4, \n               fun.data = function(x){return(c(y = stats::median(x), ymin = stats::median(x), ymax = stats::median(x)))}) + # add median line to the boxplots\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, shape = 21, fill = 'white') + # add jittered raw points\n  theme_bw(base_size = 14) + # change theme to the one I like (others are available)\n  labs(x = 'Species',\n       y = 'Bill length (mm)',\n       title = 'Do different penguin species have different bill lengths?') + # change labels\n  ylim(c(30,65)) + # change y limits\n  guides(col = 'none',\n         fill = 'none') # turn off legend\n\np1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/second_plot-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd there - with relatively few lines of code - we have a plot that is ready for inserting into a publication. This can be easily saved out using **ggsave()**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# save out plot using ggsave\nggsave('plot_one.png', p1, width = 5, height = 7)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Our favourite tips and tricks when making plots\n\nI have a set of rules I follow when making plots with **ggplot2**. Some may be different to yours but they might have some use:\n\n-   Generally I make my datasets **BEFORE** they go into **ggplot2**. This includes checking for `NA` and `Inf` values as these are super important to know about when visualising and analysing your data!\n-   \n    -   Plot the raw data whenever possible.\n-   Layers work iteratively (later layers go on top of earlier layers) so make sure layers you want to be in the background (e.g. boxplot) are before layers you want to overlay (e.g. the raw data)\n-   Only use **stat_smooth()** for exploring datasets. When plotting model predictions and confidence intervals, create a dataframe for them and then feed that into **ggplot2**.\n\n### Convert text size in geom_label() or geom_text() to pts used for labels\n\nLets say we wanted to add text to the plot. For example, in the plot above maybe we want to add the total number of penguins sampled for each species. By default **geom_text()** and **geom_label()** use a size guide that is different to the font size set for the axis and tick labels. However, Andrew Heiss has written a function to convert between those so we can easily define the font size in the regular way.\n\nWe will use functions from the **tidyverse** to create a data frame with the total number of penguins sampled and the max bill length for each penguin. Creating a data frame with the x and y coordinates of where I want the text to go on the plot, and a column for the label, is how I approach adding text labels to an existing **ggplot**.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# define function for pts\npts <- function(x){\n    as.numeric(grid::convertX(grid::unit(x, \"points\"), \"mm\"))\n  }\n\n# calculate n for putting each species\n# remove NAs because they are not in the plot\nd_n <- filter(d, !is.na(bill_length_mm)) %>%\n  group_by(species) %>%\n  summarise(n = n(),\n            max_bill_length = max(bill_length_mm)) %>%\n  ungroup()\n\n# make plot with text\n# make next box plot with raw points\np1 +\n  geom_text(aes(x = species, y = max_bill_length + 5, label = paste('n = ', n, sep = '')), d_n, size = pts(12), col = 'black') # add text label\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/example_geom_text-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Soft wrap or stagger text labels to stop them overlapping\n\nOk these two are quite recent finds for me, and I absolutely love them. Sometimes your x labels might be really long, and the text can overlap with each other. I used to manually add new lines into my text by inserting `\\n` where I wanted new text to me. But now two approaches exist that can automatically improve spacing between labels on the x axis. These are **scales::label_wrap** which can automatically create new lines for long axis labels and **guide_axis()** which can stagger axis labels to prevent overlapping.\n\nWe will demonstrate them both below, by adding the Latin names for each penguin species to the dataset. We will add them in using **case_when()** and then show both plots next to each other using **patchwork** which makes it really easy to combine individual plots. For free you also get code to italicise the axis labels as they are latin names!\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nd <- mutate(d, latin_name = case_when(species == \"Gentoo\" ~ \"Pygoscelis papua\",\n                                      species == \"Chinstrap\" ~ \"Pygoscelis antarcticus\",\n                                      species == \"Adelie\" ~ \"Pygoscelis adeliae\"))\n\n# first to softwrap the text\np2 <- ggplot(d, aes(latin_name, bill_length_mm, col = species, fill = species)) + # add first empty plot layer\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + # add boxplot, do not plot the outliers\n  stat_summary(geom = \"crossbar\", fatten = 2, color = \"white\", width = 0.4, \n               fun.data = function(x){return(c(y = stats::median(x), ymin = stats::median(x), ymax = stats::median(x)))}) + # add median line to the boxplots\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, shape = 21, fill = 'white') + # add jittered raw points\n  theme_bw(base_size = 14) + # change theme to the one I like (others are available)\n  labs(x = 'Species',\n       y = 'Bill length (mm)') + # change labels\n  ylim(c(30,65)) + # change y limits\n  guides(col = 'none',\n         fill = 'none') + # turn off legend\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(face = \"italic\")) + # italicise x axis labels\n  scale_x_discrete(labels = scales::label_wrap(10)) # soft wrap labels\n\np3 <- p2 +\n  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge = 2)) # stagger axis labels\n\np2 + p3\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot_softwrap-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEither of these look great, but I think **scales::label_wrap()** is my favourite. So simple and so effective!\n\n### Automatically label facets with letters\n\nOne thing I often do is create faceted plots where each plot represents a different treatment or subset of the data. This is really easy to do with **ggplot2** using **facet_wrap()**. However, the default facets are poorly labelled, are not numbered (generally with a, b, c for publications), and have a grey fill colour.\n\nHowever, these are all issues we can solve to create publication-ready facet labels. We will demonstrate this by plotting a different trait on each facet (bill length, bill depth, flipper length, body mass). We will create the long data using [**pivot_longer()**](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/reference/pivot_longer.html) and use **case_when()** to make sure the labels on each facet are formatted correctly (i.e. spaces instead of underscores.\n\nWe can write a function to automatically label each facet, and change theme elements to align text and change the strip background colour.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlong_format <- d %>%\n  mutate(id = 1:n()) %>% # create column to id each individual penguin\n  pivot_longer(., cols = c(bill_length_mm:body_mass_g), names_to = 'trait', values_to = 'value') %>% # go from wide to long format for the traits\n  mutate(facet_label = case_when(trait == 'bill_length_mm' ~ \"Bill Length (mm)\",\n                                 trait == \"bill_depth_mm\" ~ \"Bill Depth (mm)\",\n                                 trait == \"body_mass_g\" ~ \"Body Mass (g)\",\n                                 trait == \"flipper_length_mm\" ~ \"Flipper Length (mm)\"))\n\n# create function to add letter to facet labels\nletter_facets <- function (string){\n    len <- length(string)\n    string = paste(\"(\", letters[1:len], \") \", string, sep = \"\")\n    return(string)\n}\n\n# create plot\nggplot(long_format, aes(species, value, col = species, fill = species)) + # add first empty plot layer\n  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) + # add boxplot, do not plot the outliers\n  stat_summary(geom = \"crossbar\", fatten = 2, color = \"white\", width = 0.4, \n               fun.data = function(x){return(c(y = stats::median(x), ymin = stats::median(x), ymax = stats::median(x)))}) + # add median line to the boxplots\n  geom_jitter(width = 0.2, shape = 21, fill = 'white') + # add jittered raw points\n  theme_bw(base_size = 14) + # change theme to the one I like (others are available)\n  labs(x = 'Species',\n       y = 'Trait measurement') + # change labels\n  guides(col = 'none',\n         fill = 'none') +\n  facet_wrap(~facet_label, scales = 'free_y', labeller = labeller(facet_label = letter_facets)) + # facet by the label column so the text is correct \n  theme(strip.background = element_blank(),\n        strip.text = element_text(hjust = 0))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot_facets-1.png){fig-align='center' width=960}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBINGO THIS LOOKS SHAMAZING.\n\n### Beautiful colour schemes with MetBrewer\n\nI take a lot of time looking at colours to use in my plots. I have used [viridis](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/scale_viridis.html) before, the colour schemes from [colorbrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3), and Pokémon inspired colour schemes using [**palettetown**](https://github.com/timcdlucas/palettetown). If you are so inclined, I have also started writing a small package ([BrewerUoE](https://github.com/padpadpadpad/BrewerUoE)) to access the new University of Exeter colours in R.\n\nHowever, the most beautiful colour schemes I have ever seen are those provided by [**MetBrewer**](https://github.com/BlakeRMills/MetBrewer), which are palettes inspired by works at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. They are just sensational, and easy to add directly to your plots! We show an example how to below, but there are more examples on MetBrewer's GitHub.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np1 + \n  scale_color_manual(values=met.brewer(\"Klimt\", 3)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=met.brewer(\"Klimt\", 3))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot_metbrewer-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Add a final NULL layer to allow you to comment out layers\n\nIt is common for me to play around with different layers and switch some on and off with a hashtag. If you hash out the final layer then the layer before it with a `+` carries on to the next set of code. If you add a final `+ NULL` to the plot then this behaviour doesn't happen.\n\nLets say we wanted to see the plot without the text labels. We can turn them off by hashtagging them out (in case we want to add them back in later), and the final `NULL` means the plot still works.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np1 +\n  #geom_text(aes(x = species, y = max_bill_length + 5, label = paste('n = ', n, sep = '')), d_n, size = pts(12), col = 'black') + # add text label\n  NULL # add NULL layer to allow easy commenting out of layers\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot_null-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Control legend shapes and override legend appearance\n\nSometimes you colour text, lines, points with the same colours. When you do this, each of the legends for them get displayed in the legend overlaid with each other. To show this we will create a line plot of the relationship between \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(d, aes(body_mass_g, bill_length_mm, col = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  stat_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE) +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot_legend-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI do not like the legend with multiple geoms, to me it looks like a tram stop sign. Luckily there are easy ways to manually edit the legend.\n\nFirst we can switch off the legend of any of the elements using the argument `show.legend`.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(d, aes(body_mass_g, bill_length_mm, col = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  stat_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot_legend2-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis looks nicer. An alternative to this is to use `key_glyph` which allows you to control the shape of the legend.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(d, aes(body_mass_g, bill_length_mm, col = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  stat_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE,  key_glyph = 'point') +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot_legend3-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can also control the size of the shape in the legend by altering the legend defaults using the **guides()** function.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(d, aes(body_mass_g, bill_length_mm, col = species)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  stat_smooth(method = 'lm', se = FALSE, show.legend = FALSE) +\n  theme_bw() +\n  guides(colour = guide_legend(override.aes = list(size = 20)))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/plot_legend4-1.png){fig-align='center' width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nOk that last size is a bit much. But you get the idea and now have the tools to manually edit your legend.\n\n## Awesome ggplot2 extensions\n\n**gpgplot2** is so popular as a plotting system that it has become its own ecosystem, with people developing tools and extensions to complement and build extra functionality to **ggplot2**. All of the extensions can be found [here](https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/), but below are some of our favourites:\n\n-   [**ggdist**](https://mjskay.github.io/ggdist/) which provides geoms and stats for visualising distributions and uncertainty.\n-   [**ggtree**](https://guangchuangyu.github.io/ggtree-book/chapter-ggtree.html) to make phylogenetic trees using **ggplot2**.\n-   [**patchwork**](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) for combining separate plots.\n-   [**palettetown**](https://github.com/timcdlucas/palettetown) for Pokémon themed colour schemes. Whats better than Charizard colours!\n\n# Summary\n\nWe have shown how publication-ready plots can quickly be made using **ggplot2**, and also highlighted some functions and tips we have found super useful when we make plots. I have found that making plots in **ggplot2** follows the 80/20 rule. You get 80% of the way there in 20% of the time, but then the finishing touches can take very, very long. Hopefully some of the code, approaches, tips, and links provided here help you get started!\n\nAll of the code here can be used to create your own plots Have fun!\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n-   **ggplot2** [website](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)\n-   **ggplot2** [book](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html)\n-   **ggplot2** [cheatsheet](/posts/intro_to_ggplot2/ggplot2_cheatsheet.pdf)\n-   Cedric Scherer's whole [website](https://www.cedricscherer.com/) (I LOVE HIS VISUALISATIONS), but his [tutorial](https://www.cedricscherer.com/2019/08/05/a-ggplot2-tutorial-for-beautiful-plotting-in-r/#legends) for creating beautiful visualisations in **ggplot2** is amazing.\n\n### Acknowledgements\n\nWe did not create this content alone!
