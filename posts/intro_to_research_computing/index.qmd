## What is this about?

These workshops are a valuable opportunity for you to up-skill yourself with tools of the future â€” please do join us if you think these workshops might apply to you!

## Why should I learn this?

> "The revolution is here. Understanding how Research Computing works and being able to apply this to your work-stream could help your work and increase your impact. If you are all at sea with Research Computing then this is where to start."

The key goals of these workshops are to remove barriers to people using Research Computing and up-skill our research community to be able to make better use of the facilities available.

## OK, how do I sign-up?

The current sign-up period has closed now. However, please feel free to [fill up this form](https://forms.office.com/e/5aZMAVGENa) to express your interest in these workshops and we will look into arranging additional sessions.

### Day 1 - An Introduction to Research Computing

**Outline**: We will deliver "An introduction to Research Computing", which will be followed by examples of specific case studies based on the research needs of those of you who filled in the questionnaire. To aid in developing ARC skillsets there will be a worked example given to attendees to work through in preparation for the second session.

### Day 2 - Research Computing Case Studies and Problem Solving

**Outline**: Firstly, attendees will discuss best practices to overcome some of the challenges they identified in the earlier workshop. Secondarily, attendees will build upon the skills acquired within the self-learning exercise and use these skills to develop basics of two key types of research computing - virtual and high-performance for their specific research needs.

-   **Check out our tips [here!](./tips.html)**

-   **Take advantage of online resources**: Explore platforms like [CornwallARC](https://universityofexeteruk.sharepoint.com/sites/CornwallARC) and [ExeterARC](https://universityofexeteruk.sharepoint.com/sites/ExeterARC) for institution specific knowledge bases. Engage with discipline specific training sessions offered by [ExeDataHub](https://exeter-data-analytics.github.io/) or [CfRR](https://coding-for-reproducible-research.github.io) - these are essential to gain hands-on experience with tools and techniques. Other online resources like Coursera, edX, or DataCamp can also be very useful for programming and data analysis learning.

-   **Ask for Help**: Join the ExeDataHub [Ask for Help](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3Afca419ee420d452489888196bf05aae8%40thread.tacv2/Ask%20for%20Help?groupId=fc065562-31db-4628-a506-1a58dcfd1c8b&tenantId=912a5d77-fb98-4eee-af32-1334d8f04a53) channel to ask questions, share knowledge, and learn from peers. Active engagement with this resource is essential for the community to thrive.
